Last month, i took a basics of android programming class at my college. For that class's project, i made an android application called Flash Light. It is a simple android application which turns on and off the flashlight of the device. I haven't used any outside library for this project; only native android libraries. Then thought that only flashlight would be too easy for the project so i added magnetic compass which basically points the needle to the north based on phone's magnetic sensors. I am going to upload my code to GitHub.com in couple of days.
